The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next\\nLarry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a\\nsocial network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.\\nOf course, it’s easier to copy a model than to make something new. Doing what we already know\\nhow to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create\\nsomething new, we go from 0 to 1. The act of creation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and\\nthe result is something fresh and strange.\\nUnless they invest in the difficult task of creating new things, American companies will fail in the\\nfuture no matter how big their profits remain today. What happens when we’ve gained everything to\\nbe had from fine-tuning the old lines of business that we’ve inherited? Unlikely as it sounds, the\\nanswer threatens to be far worse than the crisis of 2008. Today’s “best practices” lead to dead ends;\\nthe best paths are new and untried.\\nIn a world of gigantic administrative bureaucracies both public and private, searching for a new\\npath might seem like hoping for a miracle. Actually, if American business is going to succeed, we are\\ngoing to need hundreds, or even thousands, of miracles. This would be depressing but for one crucial\\nfact: humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these\\nmiracles technology.\\nTechnology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental\\ncapabilities to a higher level. Other animals are instinctively driven to build things like dams or\\nhoneycombs, but we are the only ones that can invent new things and better ways of making them.\\nHumans don’t decide what to build by making choices from some cosmic catalog of options given in\\nadvance; instead, by creating new technologies, we rewrite the plan of the world. These are the kind\\nof elementary truths we teach to second graders, but they are easy to forget in a world where so much\\nof what we do is repeat what has been done before.\\nZero to One is about how to build companies that create new things. It draws on everything I’ve\\nlearned directly as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and then an investor in hundreds of startups,\\nincluding Facebook and SpaceX. But while I have noticed many patterns, and I relate them here, this\\nbook offers no formula for success. The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula\\nnecessarily cannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe in\\nconcrete terms how to be innovative. Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that\\nsuccessful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from\\nfirst principles instead of formulas.\\nThis book stems from a course about startups that I taught at Stanford in 2012. College students can\\nbecome extremely skilled at a few specialties, but many never learn what to do with those skills in\\nthe wider world. My primary goal in teaching the class was to help my students see beyond the tracks\\nlaid down by academic specialties to the broader future that is theirs to create. One of those students,'),\n",

Actually, it’s very hard to answer. It’s\\nintellectually difficult because the knowledge that everyone is taught in school is by definition agreed\\nupon. And it’s psychologically difficult because anyone trying to answer must say something she\\nknows to be unpopular. Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.\\nMost commonly, I hear answers like the following:\\n“Our educational system is broken and urgently needs to be fixed.”\\n“America is exceptional.”\\n“There is no God.”\\nThose are bad answers. The first and the second statements might be true, but many people already\\nagree with them. The third statement simply takes one side in a familiar debate. A good answer takes\\nthe following form: “Most people believe in x, but the truth is the opposite of x.” I’ll give my own\\nanswer later in this chapter.\\nWhat does this contrarian question have to do with the future? In the most minimal sense, the future\\nis simply the set of all moments yet to come. But what makes the future distinctive and important isn’t\\nthat it hasn’t happened yet, but rather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today.\\nIn this sense, if nothing about our society changes for the next 100 years, then the future is over 100\\nyears away. If things change radically in the next decade, then the future is nearly at hand. No one can\\npredict the future exactly, but we know two things: it’s going to be different, and it must be rooted in\\ntoday’s world. Most answers to the contrarian question are different ways of seeing the present; good\\nanswers are as close as we can come to looking into the future.'),\n",

That progress can take one of two\\nforms. Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that work—going from 1 to n.\\nHorizontal progress is easy to imagine because we already know what it looks like. Vertical or\\nintensive progress means doing new things—going from 0 to 1. Vertical progress is harder to imagine\\nbecause it requires doing something nobody else has ever done. If you take one typewriter and build\\n100, you have made horizontal progress. If you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you\\nhave made vertical progress.\\nAt the macro level, the single word for horizontal progress is globalization—taking things that\\nwork somewhere and making them work everywhere. China is the paradigmatic example of\\nglobalization; its 20-year plan is to become like the United States is today. The Chinese have been\\nstraightforwardly copying everything that has worked in the developed world: 19th-century railroads,\\n20th-century air conditioning, and even entire cities. They might skip a few steps along the way—\\ngoing straight to wireless without installing landlines, for instance—but they’re copying all the same.\\nThe single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology. The rapid progress of information\\ntechnology in recent decades has made Silicon Valley the capital of “technology” in general. But\\nthere is no reason why technology should be limited to computers. Properly understood, any new and\\nbetter way of doing things is technology.'),\n",

For example, 1815 to 1914 was a period of both rapid\\ntechnological development and rapid globalization. Between the First World War and Kissinger’s\\ntrip to reopen relations with China in 1971, there was rapid technological development but not much\\nglobalization. Since 1971, we have seen rapid globalization along with limited technological\\ndevelopment, mostly confined to IT.\\nThis age of globalization has made it easy to imagine that the decades ahead will bring more\\nconvergence and more sameness. Even our everyday language suggests we believe in a kind of\\ntechnological end of history: the division of the world into the so-called developed and developing\\nnations implies that the “developed” world has already achieved the achievable, and that poorer\\nnations just need to catch up.\\nBut I don’t think that’s true. My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the\\nfuture of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.\\nWithout technological change, if China doubles its energy production over the next two decades, it\\nwill also double its air pollution. If every one of India’s hundreds of millions of households were to\\nlive the way Americans already do—using only today’s tools—the result would be environmentally\\ncatastrophic. Spreading old ways to create wealth around the world will result in devastation, not\\nriches. In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable.\\nNew technology has never been an automatic feature of history. Our ancestors lived in static, zero-\\nsum societies where success meant seizing things from others. They created new sources of wealth\\nonly rarely, and in the long run they could never create enough to save the average person from an\\nextremely hard life. Then, after 10,000 years of fitful advance from primitive agriculture to medieval\\nwindmills and 16th-century astrolabes, the modern world suddenly experienced relentless\\ntechnological progress from the advent of the steam engine in the 1760s all the way up to about 1970.\\nAs a result, we have inherited a richer society than any previous generation would have been able to\\nimagine.\\nAny generation excepting our parents’ and grandparents’, that is: in the late 1960s, they expected'),\n",

From the Founding Fathers in politics to\\nthe Royal Society in science to Fairchild Semiconductor’s “traitorous eight” in business, small\\ngroups of people bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better. The\\neasiest explanation for this is negative: it’s hard to develop new things in big organizations, and it’s\\neven harder to do it by yourself. Bureaucratic hierarchies move slowly, and entrenched interests shy\\naway from risk. In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done becomes a\\nbetter strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if this describes your company, you\\nshould quit now). At the other extreme, a lone genius might create a classic work of art or literature,\\nbut he could never create an entire industry. Startups operate on the principle that you need to work\\nwith other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.\\nPositively defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a\\ndifferent future. A new company’s most important strength is new thinking: even more important than\\nnimbleness, small size affords space to think. This book is about the questions you must ask and\\nanswer to succeed in the business of doing new things: what follows is not a manual or a record of\\nknowledge but an exercise in thinking. Because that is what a startup has to do: question received\\nideas and rethink business from scratch.'),\n",

We tend to remember them as a prosperous, optimistic decade that\\nhappened to end with the internet boom and bust. But many of those years were not as cheerful as our\\nnostalgia holds. We’ve long since forgotten the global context for the 18 months of dot-com mania at\\ndecade’s end.\\nThe ’90s started with a burst of euphoria when the Berlin Wall came down in November ’89. It\\nwas short-lived. By mid-1990, the United States was in recession. Technically the downturn ended in\\nMarch ’91, but recovery was slow and unemployment continued to rise until July ’92. Manufacturing\\nnever fully rebounded. The shift to a service economy was protracted and painful.\\n1992 through the end of 1994 was a time of general malaise. Images of dead American soldiers in\\nMogadishu looped on cable news. Anxiety about globalization and U.S. competitiveness intensified\\nas jobs flowed to Mexico. This pessimistic undercurrent drove then-president Bush 41 out of office\\nand won Ross Perot nearly 20% of the popular vote in ’92—the best showing for a third-party\\ncandidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. And whatever the cultural fascination with Nirvana,\\ngrunge, and heroin reflected, it wasn’t hope or confidence.\\nSilicon Valley felt sluggish, too. Japan seemed to be winning the semiconductor war. The internet\\nhad yet to take off, partly because its commercial use was restricted until late 1992 and partly due to\\nthe lack of user-friendly web browsers. It’s telling that when I arrived at Stanford in 1985,\\neconomics, not computer science, was the most popular major. To most people on campus, the tech\\nsector seemed idiosyncratic or even provincial.\\nThe internet changed all this. The Mosaic browser was officially released in November 1993,\\ngiving regular people a way to get online. Mosaic became Netscape, which released its Navigator\\nbrowser in late 1994. Navigator’s adoption grew so quickly—from about 20% of the browser market\\nin January 1995 to almost 80% less than 12 months later—that Netscape was able to IPO in August\\n’95 even though it wasn’t yet profitable. Within five months, Netscape stock had shot up from $28 to\\n$174 per share. Other tech companies were booming, too. Yahoo! went public in April ’96 with an\\n$848 million valuation. Amazon followed suit in May ’97 at $438 million. By spring of ’98, each\\ncompany’s stock had more than quadrupled. Skeptics questioned earnings and revenue multiples\\nhigher than those for any non-internet company. It was easy to conclude that the market had gone\\ncrazy.\\nThis conclusion was understandable but misplaced. In December ’96—more than three years\\nbefore the bubble actually burst—Fed chairman Alan Greenspan warned that “irrational exuberance”\\nmight have “unduly escalated asset values.” Tech investors were exuberant, but it’s not clear that they\\nwere so irrational. It is too easy to forget that things weren’t going very well in the rest of the world\\nat the time.\\nThe East Asian financial crises hit in July 1997. Crony capitalism and massive foreign debt\\nbrought the Thai, Indonesian, and South Korean economies to their knees. The ruble crisis followed\\nin August ’98 when Russia, hamstrung by chronic fiscal deficits, devalued its currency and defaulted\\non its debt. American investors grew nervous about a nation with 10,000 nukes and no money; the\\nDow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 10% in a matter of days.\\nPeople were right to worry. The ruble crisis set off a chain reaction that brought down Long-Term\\nCapital Management, a highly leveraged U.S. hedge fund. LTCM managed to lose $4.6 billion in the\\nlatter half of 1998, and still had over $100 billion in liabilities when the Fed intervened with a\\nmassive bailout and slashed interest rates in order to prevent systemic disaster.

But we didn’t have enough customers, growth was slow, and expenses\\nmounted. For PayPal to work, we needed to attract a critical mass of at least a million users.\\nAdvertising was too ineffective to justify the cost. Prospective deals with big banks kept falling\\nthrough.

This got us hundreds of thousands of new customers and an exponential growth rate. Of\\ncourse, this customer acquisition strategy was unsustainable on its own—when you pay people to be\\nyour customers, exponential growth means an exponentially growing cost structure.

This\\nquestion is harder than it looks, because your company could create a lot of value without becoming\\nvery valuable itself. Creating value is not enough—you also need to capture some of the value you\\ncreate.\\nThis means that even very big businesses can be bad businesses. For example, U.S. airline\\ncompanies serve millions of passengers and create hundreds of billions of dollars of value each year.\\nBut in 2012, when the average airfare each way was $178, the airlines made only 37 cents per\\npassenger trip. Compare them to Google, which creates less value but captures far more. Google\\nbrought in $50 billion in 2012 (versus $160 billion for the airlines), but it kept 21% of those revenues\\nas profits—more than 100 times the airline industry’s profit margin that year. Google makes so much\\nmoney that it’s now worth three times more than every U.S. airline combined.\\nThe airlines compete with each other, but Google stands alone. Economists use two simplified\\nmodels to explain the difference: perfect competition and monopoly.\\n“Perfect competition” is considered both the ideal and the default state in Economics 101. So-\\ncalled perfectly competitive markets achieve equilibrium when producer supply meets consumer\\ndemand. Every firm in a competitive market is undifferentiated and sells the same homogeneous\\nproducts. Since no firm has any market power, they must all sell at whatever price the market\\ndetermines. If there is money to be made, new firms will enter the market, increase supply, drive\\nprices down, and thereby eliminate the profits that attracted them in the first place. If too many firms\\nenter the market, they’ll suffer losses, some will fold, and prices will rise back to sustainable levels.\\nUnder perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.\\nThe opposite of perfect competition is monopoly. Whereas a competitive firm must sell at the\\nmarket price, a monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. Since it has no competition, it\\nproduces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes its profits.\\nTo an economist, every monopoly looks the same, whether it deviously eliminates rivals, secures a\\nlicense from the state, or innovates its way to the top. In this book, we’re not interested in illegal\\nbullies or government favorites: by “monopoly,” we mean the kind of company that’s so good at what\\nit does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. Google is a good example of a company that\\nwent from 0 to 1: it hasn’t competed in search since the early 2000s, when it definitively distanced\\nitself from Microsoft and Yahoo!\\nAmericans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines.\\nActually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of\\ncapital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is\\nclear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity\\nbusiness.'),\n",

How much is truly competitive? It’s hard to say,\\nbecause our common conversation about these matters is so confused. To the outside observer, all\\nbusinesses can seem reasonably alike, so it’s easy to perceive only small differences between them.\\nBut the reality is much more binary than that. There’s an enormous difference between perfect\\ncompetition and monopoly, and most businesses are much closer to one extreme than we commonly\\nrealize.\\nThe confusion comes from a universal bias for describing market conditions in self-serving ways:\\nboth monopolists and competitors are incentivized to bend the truth.\\nMonopoly Lies\\nMonopolists lie to protect themselves. They know that bragging about their great monopoly invites\\nbeing audited, scrutinized, and attacked. Since they very much want their monopoly profits to continue\\nunmolested, they tend to do whatever they can to conceal their monopoly—usually by exaggerating the\\npower of their (nonexistent) competition.\\nThink about how Google talks about its business. It certainly doesn’t claim to be a monopoly. But\\nis it one? Well, it depends: a monopoly in what? Let’s say that Google is primarily a search engine.\\nAs of May 2014, it owns about 68% of the search market. (Its closest competitors, Microsoft and\\nYahoo!, have about 19% and 10%, respectively.) If that doesn’t seem dominant enough, consider the\\nfact that the word “google” is now an official entry in the Oxford English Dictionary—as a verb.\\nDon’t hold your breath waiting for that to happen to Bing.\\nBut suppose we say that Google is primarily an advertising company. That changes things. The U.S.\\nsearch engine advertising market is $17 billion annually. Online advertising is $37 billion annually.\\nThe entire U.S. advertising market is $150 billion. And global advertising is a $495 billion market.\\nSo even if Google completely monopolized U.S. search engine advertising, it would own just 3.4% of\\nthe global advertising market.

The\\nfatal temptation is to describe your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition.\\nSuppose you want to start a restaurant that serves British food in Palo Alto. “No one else is doing\\nit,” you might reason. “We’ll own the entire market.” But that’s only true if the relevant market is the\\nmarket for British food specifically. What if the actual market is the Palo Alto restaurant market in\\ngeneral? And what if all the restaurants in nearby towns are part of the relevant market as well?\\nThese are hard questions, but the bigger problem is that you have an incentive not to ask them at all.\\nWhen you hear that most new restaurants fail within one or two years, your instinct will be to come\\nup with a story about how yours is different. You’ll spend time trying to convince people that you are\\nexceptional instead of seriously considering whether that’s true.

Do\\noutsized profits come at the expense of the rest of society? Actually, yes: profits come out of\\ncustomers’ wallets, and monopolies deserve their bad reputation—but only in a world where\\nnothing changes.\\nIn a static world, a monopolist is just a rent collector. If you corner the market for something, you\\ncan jack up the price; others will have no choice but to buy from you. Think of the famous board\\ngame: deeds are shuffled around from player to player, but the board never changes. There’s no way\\nto win by inventing a better kind of real estate development. The relative values of the properties are\\nfixed for all time, so all you can do is try to buy them up.\\nBut the world we live in is dynamic: it’s possible to invent new and better things. Creative\\nmonopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the\\nworld. Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society; they’re powerful engines for\\nmaking it better.\\nEven the government knows this: that’s why one of its departments works hard to create\\nmonopolies (by granting patents to new inventions) even though another part hunts them down (by\\nprosecuting antitrust cases). It’s possible to question whether anyone should really be awarded a\\nlegally enforceable monopoly simply for having been the first to think of something like a mobile\\nsoftware design. But it’s clear that something like Apple’s monopoly profits from designing,\\nproducing, and marketing the iPhone were the reward for creating greater abundance, not artificial\\nscarcity: customers were happy to finally have the choice of paying high prices to get a smartphone\\nthat actually works.\\nThe dynamism of new monopolies itself explains why old monopolies don’t strangle innovation.\\nWith Apple’s iOS at the forefront, the rise of mobile computing has dramatically reduced Microsoft’s\\ndecades-long operating system dominance. Before that, IBM’s hardware monopoly of the ’60s and\\n’70s was overtaken by Microsoft’s software monopoly. AT&T had a monopoly on telephone service\\nfor most of the 20th century, but now anyone can get a cheap cell phone plan from any number of\\nproviders. If the tendency of monopoly businesses were to hold back progress, they would be\\ndangerous and we’d be right to oppose them.

Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits\\nenable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms\\nlocked in competition can’t dream of.\\nSo why are economists obsessed with competition as an ideal state? It’s a relic of history.\\nEconomists copied their mathematics from the work of 19th-century physicists: they see individuals\\nand businesses as interchangeable atoms, not as unique creators. Their theories describe an\\nequilibrium state of perfect competition because that’s what’s easy to model, not because it\\nrepresents the best of business. But it’s worth recalling that the long-run equilibrium predicted by\\n19th-century physics was a state in which all energy is evenly distributed and everything comes to\\nrest—also known as the heat death of the universe. Whatever your views on thermodynamics, it’s a\\npowerful metaphor: in business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death.
