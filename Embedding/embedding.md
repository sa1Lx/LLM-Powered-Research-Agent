Sentence Transformers (a.k.a. SBERT) is the go-to Python module for accessing, using, and training state-of-the-art embedding and reranker models. It can be used to compute embeddings using Sentence Transformer models (quickstart) or to calculate similarity scores using Cross-Encoder (a.k.a. reranker) models (quickstart). This unlocks a wide range of applications, including semantic search, semantic textual similarity, and paraphrase mining.
