Abstract: Currently, there is an intensive development of bipedal walking robots. The most known
solutions are based on the use of the principles of human gait created in nature during evolution.
Modernbipedal robots are also based on the locomotion manners of birds. This review presents
the current state of the art of bipedal walking robots based on natural bipedal movements (human
and bird) as well as on innovative synthetic solutions. Firstly, an overview of the scientiﬁc analysis
of human gait is provided as a basis for the design of bipedal robots. The full human gait cycle
that consists of two main phases is analysed and the attention is paid to the problem of balance
and stability, especially in the single support phase when the bipedal movement is unstable. The
inﬂuences of passive or active gait on energy demand are also discussed. Most studies are explored
based on the zero moment. Furthermore, a review of the knowledge on the speciﬁc locomotor
characteristics of birds, whose kinematics are derived from dinosaurs and provide them with both
walking and running abilities, is presented. Secondly, many types of bipedal robot solutions are
reviewed, which include nature-inspired robots (human-like and birdlike robots) and innovative
robots using new heuristic, synthetic ideas for locomotion. Totally 45 robotic solutions are gathered
by thebibliographic search method. Atlas was mentioned as one of the most perfect human-like
robots, while the birdlike robot cases were Cassie and Digit. Innovative robots are presented, such
asslider robot without knees, robots with rotating feet (3 and 4 degrees of freedom), and the hybrid
robot Leo, which can walk on surfaces and ﬂy. In particular, the paper describes in detail the robots’
propulsion systems (electric, hydraulic), the structure of the lower limb (serial, parallel, mixed
mechanisms), the types and structures of control and sensor systems, and the energy efﬁciency of the
robots. Terrain roughness recognition systems using different sensor systems based on light detection
and ranging or multiple cameras are introduced. A comparison of performance, control and sensor
systems, drive systems, and achievements of known human-like and birdlike robots is provided.
Thirdly, for the ﬁrst time, the review comments on the future of bipedal robots in relation to the

concepts of conventional (natural bipedal) and synthetic unconventional gait. We critically assess
and compare prospective directions for further research that involve the development of navigation
systems, artiﬁcial intelligence, collaboration with humans, areas for the development of bipedal robot
applications in everyday life, therapy, and industry.

1. Introduction
Mobile robots of various locomotion mechanisms have revealed limited built-in auton-
omy that obtains information from both internal and external sensors for pre-planned and
purpose-oriented locomotion [1–3]. Legged robots offer greater possibilities than wheeled
and tracked robots in terms of working environments. Legged robots can move over
regular and irregular terrain without any hardware modiﬁcations and have demonstrated
exceptional mobility [4]. Generally, the two-legged robot mimics the way human moves.
It is intended to undertake a variety of tasks including civilian and military activities in
hazardous conditions, entertainment and education, and assistance for the elderly and the
disabled. Owing to the smaller foot contact area with the ground and the smaller number
of driving effector, bipedal walking robots’ total energy consumption may be lower in
comparison to the multi-legged robots [5]. A historical overview of leg-driven robots and
machines, as well as an introduction to the walking pattern and stability generators, are
provided in the articles by Bekey GA [6], Raibert MH [7], and Al-Shuka [8,9], respectively.
The information gathered by the robot sensors can be used for real-time analysis of the
environment. Moreover, there are cognitive robots such as the intelligent robot companions,
which may be helpful in the therapy of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
depression, or as an aid for the elderly [10–13]. Generally, the common challenges of biped
robots include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
Bipedal robots have unstable structures due to the passive joints located at the unilat-
eral contact between the foot and the ground [14–16];
•
One-sided contact of the foot with the ground and a complex conﬁguration of the gait
cycle bring about the highly non-lineartrajectory of the bipedal robot [14,17];
•
Bipedal robots have multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs). Most researchers use simpli-
ﬁed models to reach a trade-off between simplicity and the dexterity [18];
•
Bipedal robots are most often designed to interact with unknown environments and
are expected to achieve a high level of autonomy [19,20];
•
Simulation is required as a part of many control strategies for bipedal walking [19,21].
These topics are related to advanced mechanics, control theory, electronics, artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI), and the knowledge of human anatomy. Obviously, the research and
development of bipedal walking robots are truly interdisciplinary. To solve these problems,
the close cooperation of research teams from various ﬁelds is required. As far as we know,
the ﬁrst walking robot is described in theIlliad, by Homer. A wooden walking device
named Mu Niu Liu Ma (in Chinese) was designed in the year 231. Modern studies on
humanoid robots began in the early 1960s with artiﬁcial hands and arms—for supporting
the physical work of men. In 1969, Vukabratovic et al. [22,23] developed several original
self-propelled exoskeletons to help paraplegics. However, the most well-known humanoid
robot is Asimo, created by Honda in the year 2000, based on prototype E0 (1986) [24].
Review articles on bipedal robots can be found in the scientiﬁc literature [25–30].
Wahde et al. [25] presented the research progress of biped and humanoid robotics in
the year 2002. The authors described both commercial and research projects showing
biologically inspired biped robots. Bezerra et al. [26] presented a review of the main types
of biped robots that developed until the year 2004. Silva et al. [4] provided a review in the
ﬁeld of optimization methods for the construction and manners of movement of walking

robots, which were characterized by greater energy consumption, as compared to robots on
wheels [27]. Ficht et al. [28] investigated an important aspect of the development of modern
walking robots—a humanoid robot with a fully 3D-printed structure supported by off-the-
shelf components. This method signiﬁcantly reduces the implementation cost and allows
modiﬁcations of the structure. Ye et al. [29] presented a brief overview of the methods
thatenable stable walking and running in bipedal robots. Modern methods signiﬁcantly
improve the endurance and adaptability of robots. They can traverse unknown terrain
with a variability of the ground exceeding 20% of the length of the legs. Bipedal robots can
regain balance after a sudden push, not only in a stationary state but also while in motion.
However, running is still a problem for robots.Ficht et al. [30] provided an overview on the
most advanced solutions for two-legged robots. The article presented the applied kinematic
structure of the leg drive of modern humanoid robots, and the directions of development
of bipedal robot control systems. Particular attention was paid to the technological aspects,
emphasizing the role of 3D printing in creating new solutions. Gupta and Kumar [31] have
made a good review paper concerning design models and control strategies for motion and
running of underactuated biped robots.There are interesting works on the analysis of the
dynamic walking of biped robots, for example, see the works of Westervelt et al. [32] and
Sadati et al. [33].
Regarding the broad topic of the bipedal walking robots, there is a twofold direction
of research, distinct from each other: (1) the progressive research about bipedal walking
robots, and (2) review studies (surveys of the literature) on the various research and to the
results obtained so far—a survey of the literature. In the present work, we accomplished
this in the second category. We are conscious that the current paper, despite more than
160 references cited, may address this paper more deeply—thus, it may be regarded as
introductory for further deeper and narrower studies in their focus. We hope it will inspire
researchers, engineers, and clinicians for further interdisciplinary studies paying attention
to their various detailed aspects of the very important issue of robotic bipedal walking,
e.g., low limbs exoskeletons, also controlled using a brain-computer interface as half body
neuroprosthesis.
The focus of this article is to survey the challenges that relate to the theory of human
and bird, design, drive, and control systems of bipedal robots. It considers the solutions
based on the natural biped motion (human-like and bird-like) and also synthetic, heuristic
solutions of bipedal walking machines. Section 2 presents the main biped gait issues of
humanoids and birds. Section 3 focuses on the implementation of self-developed bipedal
walking robots based onnatural gait patterns and syntheticsolutions. In Section 4, drive and
control methodology of biped walking robots, the sensing methods to support their two-
legged movement, and also energy efﬁciency are discussed. Section 5 shows the prospect
of bipedal walking robots and their potentials. Finally, the summary and conclusions are
presented in Section 6.
2. Bipedal Walking Mechanism
2.1. Bipedal Walking of Human
Walking requires integrated and coordinated activities of thenervous, muscular, and
skeletal systems, which control and enable the gait, as well as provide the closed-loop
feedback for reactive balancing and stability control. The main theories to explain the
bipedal walking are listed below [5,8,9]:
•
The evolution theory;
•
Theory of minimizing energy consumption;
•
The theory of maturation (grow from childhood to adulthood);
•
Central pattern generator theory;
•
The theory of bipedal locomotion as a result of the two cooperating mechanisms;
•
The theory of bipedal robots (gait can be generated by stability and online feedback
control [7].
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
4 of 31
Each of the aforementioned theories has some supports, but none of them comprehen-
sively explains all possible physiological and pathological mechanisms. Researchers have
attempted to extract the bipedal robot design inspirations from their biological counterparts,
but there are still many problems regarding the gait complexity of different levels:
•
The general view: the stable, controlled bipedal gait in various environments and
during fulﬁlling various meaningful tasks (including cognitive tasks);
•
Combination and transition between thedifferent modes of bipedal locomotion: walk-
ing and running without falling [34];
•
The high-level control of walking: cooperation of trajectory planning algorithms and
central pattern generators [35];
•
The high-and low-level signal processing: translation of ground contact into signals
activating particular joints and muscles [36,37];
•
The adaptive control layer that considers dynamic stability, detecting ground move-
ment or slippery surfaces during walking.
Many of the above-mentioned problems are possible to solve based on the theory
of nonlinear dynamical systems (stability/equilibrium analysis, cycle properties, multi-
fractal analysis) [35]. However, no one-size-ﬁts-all criterion ensures the equilibrium of
bipedal robots.
2.2. Application of Bipedal Gait of Humans for Biped Robots
A better understanding of the bipedal walking robots comes from the analysis of
human walking behaviour adaptation strategies that are based on interlimb and intralimb
coordination. Goswami [38] analysed a biped robot’s postural stability and foot rotation.
Furthermore, analyses of passive walking with knees were presented in [39]. Early studies
of these mechanisms were based on a split-belt treadmill. A two-tier bipedal walking control
model was described by Fujiki et al. [40]. Its main principles were based on the following:
•
Independent neural control of parameters during gait;
•
The coupling of the metatarsal to the medullary regulation;
•
The ability to adapt and remember the new inter-acting patterns;
•
Involvement of the cerebellum in generating substantive commands based on foot signals;
•
The interaction of the cerebellum with the brainstem is a key control for interlimb
coordination in slow walking [41–43].
Gait pattern is generalized to natural walking even if the vision is removed [44]. This has
been achieved thanks to evolution, experience, training, and trial-and-error practice [45].
2.3. Concepts of Bipedal Walking Robots Based on Human Walking
Humans and animals have matchless mobility abilities due to their versatile mechani-
cal reconﬁguration capabilities. The features of animal and human locomotion systems are
analysed [46,47]. During the movement, humans use about 20 DOFs from all the 300 DOFs
of the musculoskeletal system [18,48,49]. Based on this observation, the following important
observations from previous literature are summarized:
•
The majority of researchers try to adapt the idea of human walking using simpliﬁed
models [9]. Among possible choices there are 2-link model [8,50], 3-link model [51],
5-link model [17,52,53], 30-DOFs humanoid [54], etc.
•
The complete gait cycle of human walking consists of two main successive phases:
the double support phase (DSP, 20%) and the single support phase (SSP, 80%) with
intermediate sub-phases (toe-off, forward swing, and heel strike) [54]. DSP results in a
closed chain mechanism, while the SSP starts when one of the feet begins the forward
swing phase [55].
•
Balance and stability problem is important especially during the SSP when bipedal
motion is unstab [56]. In general, there are two kinds of stability criteria: static and
dynamic. Static stability depends on the vertical projection of the centre of mass on the
support surface [57] and allows to simplify the design of bipedal robots considerably
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
5 of 31
and open-loop balancing can be assumed with large enough feet [58]. For dynamic
stability, the following methods are usually considered: zero moment point (ZMP) [57],
centroidal angular momentum [59], footstep-based criteria [60], and periodicity-based
gait [61–64]. Further details can be also found in previous literature [6,9,65].
Remark 1. Some researchers consider the ZMP-based locomotion as static motion as long as the
walking is slow in comparison with motion of periodicity-based stability. In effect, most passive
walkers lie within the category of periodicity-based motion. The passive walkers use minimum
actuators for motion on a plane surface or even without actuators but with an inclined surface for
walking. In contrast to active walkers that use full actuation or over actuation strategy for walking,
most of them are designed based on the ZMP, see [31,66] for more details.
Remark 2. The human walks using muscles and nerves as actuators and controller elements, respec-
tively. Without the muscles and nerves, the human behaves as a passive walker [64]. Consequently,
the bipedal robot can be modelled as an inverted pendulum with passive dynamic walking that
exploits dynamics only, e.g., McGeer’s passive walker [67,68]. In view of the above, bipedal robots
have been known to exhibit complex behaviour like chaos and bifurcations with hybrid algebraic-
differential equations [64,69]. Simple models were selected to investigate chaos and bifurcations
phenomenon such as compass-gait biped [70], point-feet straight legged robot [71], semi-passive
biped actuated in torso [72], an underactuated bipedal robot with constant torque being applied on
the support leg [73], a 3D passive walker [74], and rimless wheel models [75]. On the other hand,
thePoincaré map is a powerful tool to investigate the stability of passive dynamic walkers; however,
difﬁcult computations arise in solution of complex biped systems. Therefore, Zengui et al. [69]
proposed time linearization of the hybrid bipedal system with a state feedback controller to stabilize
the linearized Poincaré map. In general, two basic methods are available for controlling chaos [76]:
the Ott–Grebogi–Yorke method and the delayed feedback control method, see [64] and the references
therein for more details.
One of the important issues of biped locomotion is the generation of the optimal
trajectory that provides the stability while avoiding collisions with obstacles. In practice,
several algorithms can be combined to generate bipedal locomotion patterns [6]:
•
The learning process (requires intelligence);
•
A considerable level of ability to adapt to different conditions or to solve tasks of
different obstacles in the terrain;
•
Under certain conditions (e.g., long-distance walking), optimal movement to reduce
walking energy consumption.
Most designers and scientists proposed control systems for bipedal robots based
on predeﬁned trajectories. Methods used for online ZMP compensation can be based
on preview control [77], model predictive control [65,78–82], or AI [83,84]. In contrast,
modern systems, based on artiﬁcial intelligence, can produce sound results without direct
modelling of the phenomena [85], although there are different approaches adopted to
generate balanced/stabilized walking patterns. Hayder A.S. et al. [9] present the classiﬁ-
cation of gait generation approach based on model, biological mechanisms, and natural
dynamics [19,52,58,86].
2.4. Selected Issues of Bird Gait
In nature, several animals have been known to move perfectly on two legs such as
dinosaurs. Thulborn [87] gave the known relationships derived from mammals such as
speed, gait, and body size to determine the gaits and theoretical maximum speeds of
dinosaurs. He concluded that smaller bipedal dinosaurs ran at speeds of up to 35 or
40 km/h, “ostrich dinosaurs” 35–40 km/h, and up to 60 km/h. Larger bipedal dinosaurs
were walking or slowly trotting with speeds in the range of 15 to 20 km/h. According to
the theory of evolution, birds are one of the closest successors of the dinosaurs—they also
move on two legs independently of if they can ﬂy or not. Alexander [88] analysed the gaits
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
6 of 31
of different animals (reptiles, birds, and mammals). He concluded that mammals move
similarly when the Froude number is considered, as shown in Equation (1):
F = u2
gh
(1)
where: u is the speed, g denotes the acceleration, and h stands for the height of the hip.
In another paper [89], the author observed that, in addition to humans and birds
utilizing bipedal walking mechanisms, cockroaches can also run in bipedal mode. Many
birds walk and run with knees bent, back and femurs in a position near to horizontal. The
author showed the differences between the two-legged movement of humans and birds.
In humans, two peaks of force can be observed during walking, and a single peak when
running. Two peaks of force similar to that of human walking are also observed in birds.
Human walking is energy efﬁcient, but human running is rather expensive. For birds,
bipedal locomotion is economical for wading birds, and expensive for geese and penguins.
Abourachid et al. [90] presented a short review of the biological bipeds to explain the
differences between the body structures of humans and birds. The authors proposed a bird
model scaled up to the same mass and height of the centre of mass as a humanoid model.
The results of such simulation showed the advantage of the bird model in comparison
with the humanoid model. Results have also conﬁrmed the possibility of decomposition
of the bird’s system on the trunk and thighs as one part, and leg as a second part. The
authors noted that the movement of birds may be a good inspiration for building walking
robots. Daley et al. [91] observed that birds are ecologically diverse and span a large range
of body size and limb proportions, yet they all use their hind limbs for bipedal terrestrial
locomotion. The authors also indicated that birds use different strategies depending on
terrain such as:
•
Independent control of the angular movement and the length of the legs to ensure
dynamic stability;
•
Control of the speed of movement with positive feedback to ensure a constant load on
the legs in uneven terrain;
•
Adjusting the muscles to the load, which stabilizes the mechanical energy usage of
the body;
•
Complex regeneration strategies that allow changing the dynamics of the body, while
regulating the load on the legs, which in turn minimizes the risk of falling.
The authors [92] analysed the scaling of the gait of bipedal birds related to the load and
muscle power that results in adapting the frequency of the gait. The stability and agility of
movement were also analysed. At dynamically similar speeds, small birds use relatively
shorter stride lengths and higher stride frequencies as compared to large birds. Birds with
long legs as compared to their mass, use longer strides and lower swing frequencies. Birds
are the only living animals that can stand, walk, and run on two legs, just like a human. At
the same time, the fastest birds (ostriches) are much faster than humans. The movement
of birds is also very agile. This is due to the different structures of the kinematic system
and muscles in comparison to the human gait. Leveraging biological patterns of bird
movement is an inspiration for bipedal robot’s alternative [90] to humanoid robots that
have been developed for many years. The construction of bird-inspired bipedal robots will
be presented in the next section.
3. Designs of Biped Walking Robots
3.1. Overview of Bipedal Robots
To reveal the current state of the art, a search and review of the literature on bipedal
robots published up to 31 December 2021 was conducted using the following keywords:
“bipedal walking” and “bipedal robot”. The following electronic databases were searched:
Scopus, Pubmed/Medline, PeDro, Cochrane, Pro-Quest as far as MeRoDa (Medical Robotic
Database). After evaluation of publications according to their titles, abstracts, and full
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440

texts, a narrative review was performed. In a six-year window, all articles dealing with the
walking robots that can be found on Google Scholar represent around 10,000 titles. The
state of knowledge is based mainly on narrative reviews as well as on previous technical
reports. The design of bipedal walking robots presented in Table 1 can be divided into
solutions based on the following biological patterns:
•
Human Biped Walking Robots (HBWR);
•
Bird Biped Walking Robots (BBWR);
•
Synthetic Biped Walking Robots (SBWR)—other solutions based on a heuristic, syn-
thetic ideas.

Humanoid robots are bipedal walking devices built to resemble human-like locomo-
tion. Do-It-Yourself bipeds are characterized by a simple kinematic chain design to reduce
actuation costs and simplify the control system; such designs are designed towards simple
manufacturing—often low-cost 3D printing or laser cutting of all the parts. Another typical
feature of such designs is their open-hardware and open-source licensing.

3.2. Human Biped Walking Robots (HBWR)
Most of the solutions presented in Table 1 are designed by imitatingthe human walk-
ing mechanism. Two-legged robots mimicking human walking mechanisms are capable
of passing over or avoiding obstacles; however, they are characterized by complex con-
struction and control. For an efﬁcient walking pattern, the bipedal robot needs 12 DOFs,
as in the best solutions of bipedal walking robots, for example ASIMO [24]. There are
attempts to simplify the kinematic structure of two-legged robots to 6 DOFs (Lim andYeap
walking robot [127]), which results in a moderate reduction of movement capabilities. The
robots presented up to this point are most often equipped with rotary or linear actuators
electrically driven by DC servos or stepper motors. Boston Dynamics, in 2013, unveiled
the prototype of the two-legged walking robot Atlas [101], powered by a hydraulic system.
Then in 2016 [102], the company presented an excellent design with a perfectly reﬁned
hydraulic muscular system. This type of drive provides enormous strength and excellent
dynamics. Initially, the controls were in development and the robot’s gait was wobbly. In
2019 [103], Boston Dynamics presented Atlas with improved software, which does not
directly control the robot’s joints; instead, it uses pre-programmed relations between the
robot’s features and its relation to environment interaction. The Atlas robot uses the whole
body for balancing and performing acrobatic movements like jumping over obstacles or
back-ﬂips [103]. Undoubtedly, the solution presented by the Boston Dynamics company
sets a completely new level in terms of the construction of walking robots.
3.3. Bird-Based Biped Walking Robots (BBWR)
Recently, new solutions for two-legged walking robots areput forward using biolog-
ical patterns that are not inspired by human gait, instead, they resemble birds walking
mechanics. The examples of such walking robots are Cassie [118] and Digit [122]. We can
see the difference between the structure of leg joints for human-based robots and Cassie
or Digit robots that are similar to birds’ lower bodies. The key feature of those robots is
excellent manoeuvrability and the possibility to move in difﬁcult terrain. The Cassie robot
was a protoplast for the Digit, which, as an evolution design, was equipped with arms and
a head containing a LIDAR system for navigation [122]. The Cassie robot presents excellent
walking and jogging capabilities; in addition, it exhibits good manoeuvrability due to the
quick rotation [139]. These robots quickly reached a high level of design in comparison to
the best solution of humanoid robots due to the advances in control systems of humanoid
robots and using a unique drive design.
3.4. Synthetic Bipedal Walking Robots (SBWR)
The last section of Table 1 presented synthetic walking designs. The designs utilize
a cyclical leg shifting mechanism to maintain stability by ensuring the centre of gravity
projection on the ﬂoor stays underneath the grounded feet. Table 1 presents two such solu-
tions that combine the sliding motion to produce vertical leg movement when transferring
the load from one leg to the other. Wang et al. [135,136] proposed an innovative design
of a two-legged robot called SLIDER, which used a sliding joint in each leg to replace the
knee–hip rotary motion that was used in nature for leg lifting [135,136].
The design prepared at the Imperial College of London [135] uses linear movements of
the straight leg in the hip, replacing the effect of knee–hip combined rotation. The innovative
aspect of the SLIDER design is the compact and lightweight mechanism of vertical hip
movement. The proposed system of locomotion of the SLIDER robot uses only 5 DOFs per
leg—totally giving 10 DOFs. Simulated robot motion animations are presented in [136].
One of the challenges in two-legged robots is the execution of twists and turnaround
motions. The new innovative solution of walking mechanism—which is not based on hu-
man gait as most solutions of two-legged walking robots—was presented by
Mikołajczyk et al. [131–134]. This new walking mechanism uses two parallel legs sliding
in corps and is equipped with swivel feet as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. An innovative bipedal robot with swivel feet: DR, DL—drives of feet, FR, FL—swivel feet of
robo, DC—drive of robots leg, COG—centre of gravity, L—distance between feet axis, H—vertical
move of feet: (a) 3 DOF robot balancing mass moved using DC drive; (b) 4 DOF robot balancing mass
moving using DG—independent balancing drive.
The 3 DOF robot is equipped with three drives (Figure 1a): central common drive—
DC uses gear control of moving legs in the vertical direction, drives of swivel feet control:
right foot—DR and left foot—DL, respectively, on αR and αL angle. This way the robot
is equipped with 3 DOFs, in which the 1st DOF is controlled by vertical simultaneous
movements of the legs, and the remaining two DOFs are the rotations of the feet parallel to
the ground surface (Figure 1a). For static stabilization, gear connection to balancing mass is
used to move the centre of gravity—COG—from one foot to another. The movement of the
mass in the simplest version is mechanically combined with the leg motions (Figure 1a).
The sequence of a single robot step is as follows (the robot stands on two feet–starting from
the left foot):
•
The start of the central common drive (DC) that rotates left moving the right leg
concerning the left one, at the same time the mass moves and stabilizes the robot’s
centre of gravity (see the example centre of gravity—COG—position) within the left
foot’s footprint;
•
The central driver (DC) stops;
•
Left foot (DL) swivels motor is started to rotate the robot around the left foot by αL angle;
•
Left foot drive (DL) is stopped when the ﬁnal angular position is reached;
•
Central common drive (DC) starts to rotate right by ϕ angle lowering the right leg
and at the same time the stabilizing mass moves to the upright position and the robot
statically stabilizes on both feet.
Then the sequence repeats. When the DC drive moves on ϕ angle, legs move in the
vertical direction by distance:
H = 2Rϕ,
(2)
where: R is the radius of the gear and ϕ is the gear rotation angle.
During the walk, rotation of the foot is used for robot progression. The length of step S
depends on the value of the rotation angle α (αR or αL) and the distance between the legs L:
S = 2Lsin
α
2

(3)
where: L is the distance between the legs, and α foot rotation angle.
The rotational degree of freedom in the foot enables changing the direction of locomo-
tion, signiﬁcantly exceeding the capabilities of conventional stepping robots.

A three-dimensional printed prototype of the 3 DOFs robot [131] was driven by three
DC servos using the Pololu Maestro controller board. Thanks to the rotation of the foot, the
robot is characterized by unprecedented agility among bipedal robots. Extending RotoFoot
with the fourth degree of freedom (4 DOFs) at the torso, enabled the robot to climb stairs
by improving control of the COG location using an independent balancing drive (DG) (see
Figure 1b). A prepared 3D printed prototype of 4 DOF can climb stairs [134]. The new type
of robotic synthetic drive can ﬁnd different applications. For example, this robot can be
used as an intelligent robot-companion or delivery robot. This type of walking robot seems
to be particularly convenient to walk on ﬂat surfaces; at the same time, the idea presented
also allows for climbing stairs.
A robot called LEONARDO (LEgsONboARDdrOne), or LEO for short, is a versatile
design that enables two main modes of movement walking as well as ﬂying [137]. This
robot presents synchronized agile walking movements interspersed with ﬂight manoeuvres.
This allows it to perform manoeuvres that are difﬁcult for traditional walking robots such
as skating or walking on a rope. LEO consists of three main subsystems, namely a torso, a
propeller drive system, and two legs with pointing feet. The robot legs are constructed of
carbon ﬁbre tubes and 3D printed carbon ﬁbre reinforced joints with ball bearings. They
constitute a parallel kinematic mechanism with brushless DC (BLDC) drives with gears
located close to the torso, providing a compact form with reduced leg inertia. Both legs are
symmetrical, and each leg has three servos for actuation. The ﬁrst is located at the pelvis
and moves the leg structure in the frontal plane of the LEO. The other two servo motors are
located at the front and the back of the hips and drive the parallel leg mechanism. Thanks to
applied solutions LEO weighs only 2.58 kg. Its height while walking is 75 cm. The solution
uses high-friction urethane polygamy as a pointed foot with a load cell for ground contact.
The robot uses sensors to detect the contact with the ground.
LEO can then execute the walking phase using inverted pendulum control, but this is
aided by the operation of the propellers. The robot’s construction allows it to change its
conﬁguration during the ﬂight phase. LEO can operate completely autonomously with its
onboard computers and sensor set; it also has other capabilities of moving all of which can
be found in [138].
4. Drive and Control Systems of Biped Walking Robots
Modern walking robots are equipped with drive control systems and sensor systems
to support both the operation of the robot’s mechanism and environmental recognition
systems. The solutions applied in these systems for main bipedal walking robots are
presented in this section.
4.1. Drive Systems
Ficht et al. [30] put forward the applied kinematic structure of the leg drive of modern
bipedal robots. Both rotary and linear drives are summarized. He distinguished between
ﬁve main causes of the structure of lower limb drives:
•
Serial drive on-axis;
•
Serial drive off-axis (requires gear);
•
Parallel mechanism cranks-lever;
•
Parallel mechanism, with a linear drive;
•
Mixed serial/parallel mechanism.
Modern robots are driven by the use of electric drives, less often hydraulic ones [30].
Electric drive is used as:
•
Harmonic drive (ASIMO [24], HRP-5P [121], Toro [105], TALOS [120];
•
Cycloid driver (Cassie [118], Digit [122]);
•
Muscle/tendons (Kengoro [116]);
•
DC servo NimbRo-OP2 [119]);
•
Serial elastic actuator SEA (Valkyrie [111], WALK-MAN [107]).
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
12 of 31
Hydraulic drives are used as:
•
Servo-valves (Atlas robots [101]);
•
Electro-hydrostatic actuator—EHA (Hydra [117]).
4.2. Control Systems
Four possible criteria are commonly used as the equilibrium/stabilization indicators
for a bipedal robot: zero moment point (ZMP), point care map for limit-cycle walking,
angular momentum-based criterion, and footstep-based criterion. As a result, the ﬁrst
two criteria are necessary to generate feasible biped motion, and the last two criteria are
possible assistive indicators that can be used to recover the biped balance caused by external
perturbation. There are explicit relationships between the ZMP, COG angular momentum,
and the footstep, see [6] for more details. However, there are three problems related to the
stabilization control of bipedal robots:
•
First, how to generate the desired reference trajectory for a biped with high degrees
of freedom.
•
The second is how to guarantee (feasibly balance/stabilized) reference trajectory for
the robot. This question is relevant if approximate models for trajectory planning
are used.
•
The third is how to precisely track the desired angular joint references considering the
computational complexity of the high degrees of freedom of the biped. For example,
Figure 2 suggests a general multi-level stabilization control for ZMP-based biped robot.
Figure 2. Multi-level control architecture with four control layers: High-level control, Mid-level
control 1, Mid-level control 2, Tracking low-level control.
There is no prevailing approach. Simple models cover basic multisegmented bal-
listic and passive gait models. Ballistic bipedal walking robots can analyse internal sig-
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440

nals such as energy consumption or the level of disturbances [140–143]. Simple mutually
coupled Rayleigh oscillators for feedback control of a walking robot were described by
de Pina et al. [144] and Luo et al. [145]. Zieli´nska described four coupled oscillators gener-
ating real-time outputs similar to human gait [57]. Chen et al. [146] presented sensor data
fusion for the state of body estimation in stable walking using feedback control. Klein and
Lewis provided a neuro robotic model based on Golgi tendon organs, and spiking neural
networks [147]. Different feed forward strategies to recover from a trip or slip causing a fall
due to response in muscle(s) excitation status were described by Forner-Cordero et al. [148].
Neural control models coupled with dynamical models driven by joint moments showed
integrative properties of the neuromusculoskeletal systems within stable gait and indi-
vidual muscle contribution to trunk support [149]. Even gait disorders associated with
Guillan-Barré syndrome or spinal cord injury may be effectively reﬂected in walking assis-
tant robots [150,151]. Based on the previous studies, it can be assumed that stable bipedal
locomotion may be achieved by combining:
•
Reﬂex-based control (e.g., artiﬁcial neural network) [152];
•
Signals from local sensors;
•
Simpliﬁcation of bipedal robot kinematic construction;
•
Adaptive compensation of small disturbances through controlling its dynamical
properties [153].
For more details on control strategies of biped walking that are based on energy
efﬁciency, see, e.g., [33,62,64]. Multi-level control architecture with four-level layers using
different sensors is presented in Figure 2.
High-level control. The highest level of the inverted pendulum problem has to be
solved using a model (IPM), see [6]. There are two essential problems at this control level:
•
How to keep continuous COG state variables while changing the biped status/
orientation? A modiﬁcation to the IPM is required as discussed in [2].
•
How to reduce the modelling error caused by the IPM inaccuracy? This can be answered
by the mid-level control 1.
Mid-level control 1. It is responsible for a compensation of modelling error that results
from the high-level control. Proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control or advanced
control strategies, e.g., preview control can be used for regulation of the ZMP indirectly by
tracking the referential COG.
Mid-level control 2. It includes the inverse kinematics model of the robot and algo-
rithm based on the calculation of the desired COG generated by the last level control and the
referential foot trajectory. This control level can be avoided if task space coordinates-based
dynamics are used rather than joint space-based dynamics.
Tracking low-level control is based on the precise observation of the reference points
of the joints deﬁned by inverse kinematics. A simple PID or advanced control structure can
be used in this control layer. This control is recommended to be distributed or decentralized
for a high number of DOFs biped mechanisms to avoid computational problems.
4.3. Sensor Systems
Position sensors on the motors provide data during locomotion that are key for
both current state identiﬁcation during the gait and biped robot further steps planning.
Chen et al. [146] described a joint sensor system with a Kalman ﬁlter for the feedback
control of the walking robot.
The sensor system of biped robots was presented in [154–156]. Control of walking
robots heavily depends on the progress in the ﬁeld of mechatronics and the development
of computer technology. Drive systems and advanced sensing and vision systems were
the key developments enabling stable control of walking robots. There are new solutions
for bipedal robots. The most advanced systems are developed in the USA and Japan, see
Table 1 for details. For a biped robot to walk safely in complex environments, several
sensor systems are required to sense/observe any obstacle or external objects. A good
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
14 of 31
sensor system should be selected to recognize the correct foot placement while walking
with different conﬁgurations. The sensor system can be subdivided into ﬁve categories:
•
Body orientation system. To capture the trunk tilt of the biped, inertial measurement unit
(IMU) sensors are commonly used, as they contain accelerometers and gyroscopes
that through sensor fusion can be used for reliable orientation estimation. They are
installed on the trunk in addition, some IMUs are placed on the feet to detect the feet
inclination. Incremental, high-resolution encoders are often connected to joint motor
shafts to measure joint positions and allow computation of positions and velocities.
For detailed characteristics of these sensors, see the examples [154–156].
•
Foot sole sensor system (Force sensors). The ground reaction forces play an important
role in the stabilization of the biped mechanism and detecting ground stability. If these
forces are outside the stability region, the foot may slip, and the biped robot might be
not able to avoid a fall. Therefore, controlling these forces is necessary via conﬁning
the ground reaction forces to stay within the support foot/feet. This strategy meets
the concept of ZMP. The ground reaction force wrench can be measured by placing
four six-axes force/torque sensors on the foot sole.
•
Touch sensor system. Some biped robots are designed to work in a home environment
where there is a contact (touch) between the robot and human. Therefore, it is rec-
ommended to install the tactile sensor at speciﬁc locations to avoid trapping human
hands/ﬁngers in-between the robot joints. For example, [156] has used 19 tactile
sensors placed inside the main elements of the robot. If these sensors are activated,
then the biped robot attempts to release the joint forces.
•
Force sensing. In the case of electric drives, monitoring of forces that robots can apply
can be done using simple current sensing that can be part of the motor controller
or external circuitry. For hydraulic actuation systems, pressure sensors installed on
supply lines can be utilized to quantify force production.
•
Audio sensor system. This sensor system is necessary for online communication with
humans where a multi-microphone system is built. For example, the solution [156]
installed seven audio sensors (microphones) on the head of the biped mechanism.
•
Visual sensor system. Here, most typically, the head is equipped with a stereo camera-
based vision system to identify objects and avoid obstacles, see [157] for more details
on this topic.
4.4. Navigation Systems of Bipedal Robots in Uneven Terrain
Modern walking robots with environment recognition functions can move in un-
known terrain [158–162]. They appeared as a response to the modern threats, where robots
can replace humans in emergencies and harsh environments like ﬁre, radiation (e.g., the
Fukushima disaster), or in outer space [159]. Robot environment recognition systems
are equipped with heads that include various sensors. The Light Detection and Ranging
(LIDAR) system is used for real-world orientation. Visual sensors are effectively utilized
for Visual Odometry (VO), and LIDAR sensors are used for LIDAR Odometry (LO) [162].
Unfortunately, such measurements commonly suffer from outliers in a dynamic environ-
ment, since frequently it is assumed that only the robot is in motion and the world is static.
Moving objects in the environment need to be ﬁltered out to provide reliable odometry.
Developed by Carnegie Melon University Multisense SL/SLB, a camera-based vision
system was combined with a movable LIDAR sensor [159]. Such a system can be considered
a fully functioning humanoid robot head as it allows the robot to “see” a very large
scene around it without having to activate cameras or the neck. Several humanoid robots
participating in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) [159] are equipped with Multisense
SL/SLB, such as Atlas-DRC and Atlas-Unplugged [160], WALK-MAN [107]. Moreover, the
birdlike robot Digit [122] from Agility Robotics uses a LIDAR sensor.
Pieces of information from the camera-based system and LIDAR sensor are used by
special processing software. The authors [161] present an algorithm for the probabilistic
fusion of sensor data from different sensors (inertial, kinematic, and LIDAR) to produce
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
15 of 31
a single consistent position estimate for a walking humanoid. Fallon et al. [160] describe
the perception and planning algorithms that have allowed a humanoid robot to use only
passive stereo imagery without LIDAR to safely plan footsteps to continuously walk over
rough and uneven surfaces without stopping. Experimental results conﬁrmed this idea.
The robust Gaussian Error-State Kalman Filter for humanoid robot locomotion is presented
in [163]. The introduced method automatically detects and rejects outliers without relying
on any prior knowledge of measurement distributions or ﬁnely tuned thresholds.
4.5. Comparison of Known Modern Bipedal Robots Based on Human or Bird Walking
In Table 2, some features of the most known modern bipedal walking robots whose
design are based on human or bird’s gait are presented. Chosen robots are shown in order
of the year of their ﬁrst introduction. Certainly, robots are systematically developed. In this
table summary of utilizing sensors, control systems, and type and number of drives are
also given. Additionally, for some robots, their walking speed and load-carrying capacity
for hands is also presented. All walking robots presented in Table 2 are equipped with
sensors for monitoring the position of the joints. In addition, some are also equipped with
torque or force sensors for joints. Most robots use IMU sensors for orientation in space.
A few use the LIDAR system for this purpose. All humanoid robots are equipped with
various types of vision systems. The Digit robot, which is rather a hybrid of a humanoid
robot (torso with arms) and bird base walking platform, also utilizes LIDAR. The Cassie
robot is not equipped with a camera. This model was mainly used to study walking and
running functions based on bird ideas, while environment recognition and processing were
not required in this project as the robot was controlled by an animator. The presented
comparison shows that not only LIDAR can produce a good surrounding recognition
function, but several robots also achieve excellent results in environment perception with
the sole use of cameras. Apart from the Atlas robot, all other robots presented in Table 2
are equipped with various types of electric drives. However, the Atlas robot [96–98,160],
which is equipped with a control system based on a LIDAR scanner and stereo vision and
utilizes hydraulic motors for driving joints (Table 2) presents excellent possibilities in terms
of precision and dynamics of movement, and the ability to move in difﬁcult terrain.
An excellently tuned selection of sensors combined with state-of-the-art software
provides distinctive opportunities for human interaction. It should be emphasized that
the team of designers and programmers achieved these results in a relatively short time.
Compared to the other robots, Atlas is distinguished by a much lower weight owing to
the utilization of hydraulic drives that additionally provide excellent dynamics [103]. The
performance of the bipedal walking robots using the bird’s movement pattern is also
impressive: the low weight and the limited number of drives. Cassie [118] and Digit [122]
robots are characterized by the original construction of the legs using the cycloid drive,
which enables the use of very lightweight legs. It should also be emphasized that the
slightly smaller NimbRo-OP2 [117] robot is made with the 3D printing technique, which
ensures both low weight (due to the possibility of structure optimization) and a wide set of
options for developing and improving the elements of the structure.
Advanced walking robots, which are based on a humanoid gait model, require a
complex drive and control systems with many sensors. Moreover, a new type of knee-less
walking mechanism [135,136] requires an advanced control system. It is a result of the
number of DOFs. On the other hand, the developed synthetic walking mechanism for a
bipedal walking robot with swivel feet [131–134] does not require a complicated control
system due to the use of a small number of DOFs and its static stabilization method. The
3 DOFsRotoFoot robot requires three drives combined with three potentiometers-based
position sensors for closed-loop control ϕ, αR and αLα angles. The 4 DOFs robot, where
the extra DOF is used for an independent mass movement (Figure 1b), enabled climbing
stairs [134].

4.6. Energy Sources of Robots
Robots can be actuated in a number of ways; hydraulic, pneumatic, and electric
drive systems are common solutions. In any case, the control and sensing systems require
electricity for operation. This implies need for electrical supply in any way, which can be
achieved by providing separate electric energy source for control or by utilizing energy
conversion from the main energy source. Yang et al. [164] presents the summary of different
energy sources for robotics. He divides all sources on:
•
Energy storage, including batteries and capacitors/supercapacitors;
•
Power generators—fuel cells, classical electromagnetic generators, and solar cells;
•
Power harvesting (phototovoltaic, electrochemical, wireless, thermoelectric, etc.) and nano-
generators (micro-/nano-energy sources, self-powered sensors, and flexible transducers).
The main energy source for mobile robots is rechargeable batteries. For best perfor-
mance, low weight, high current draw capability, and high capacity are required. Low-
est cost per Wh can be obtained from lead-acid batteries, but they provide the lowest
energy density per weight unit (35–40 Wh/kg) [165]. On the other end, LiFePO4 batter-
ies are placed with the highest unit cost but also highest energy density per unit weight
(90–160 Wh/kg) [166]. Some years ago, rechargeable battery technologies were used (Ni-Cd
or Ni-MH–cell voltage 1.2 V), but the best are now Li-ion batteries with the highest energy
density 100–265 Wh/kg, cells voltage 3.6 V, without memory effect and low self-discharge
effect (1.5–2% per month) [167]. A problem with Li-ion batteries is the possibility to ﬁre.
Li-ion batteries for walking robots (1.1 kWh) produced by CEO [168] uses 4 ventilators
for cooling of 98 cell (302.4 V). Detailed review for battery technology is provided in [169].
Li-ion batteries, however, have two main limitations—low energy capacity as compared to
combustible fuels (petrol for example provides 13 kWh/kg, natural gas—15 kWh/kg, and
hydrogen—34 kWh/kg), and relatively long charging time as compared to refuelling time.
Compressed air can be stored with energy density in the range of 398 Wh/kg, which places
it somewhere between batteries and combustion engines or fuel cells [170]. Hydrogen fuel
cells are especially interesting, as electrical energy production is achieved without any
moving components and almost noiselessly. Drawback of fuel cell technology is the weight
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440

of hydrogen tanks [171]. Diesel motor combined with hydraulic pumps and/or generator
is a relatively simple solution for large robots; in smaller robots, such construction would
have a signiﬁcant vibration problem [172]. Fluid powered actuators provide advantage
over electrical drives in terms of lower weight and high force, low speed characteristics that
in electric drives are achieved using gearboxes that add to system weight and complexity.
Fluid actuators characteristics are especially desired in walking robots.
Robots designed for short time operation can be powered by compressed air, electricity
from supercapacitors, or batteries offering a relatively simple design. Electrical power
storage is important in any case due to the control electronics and sensor systems utilized in
robotics. Energy recovery or harvesting during operation requires an intermediate energy
storage system that can accept large energy input in short time—for example in braking
energy recovery. For this purpose, in case of electrical energy, supercapacitors are a good
alternative; in case of ﬂuid powered robots, pressure tanks serve the same function. Me-
chanical energy can also be stored for example in ﬂywheels [173] or springs. Nevertheless,
energy conversion between different systems is one of the sources of inefﬁciency of the
drive train; therefore, it is foreseen that in the future most robots are going to utilize an
energy source mix that supports actuation and control speciﬁc to the work environment
of the robot and special application conditions. Currently, there is no ideal solution that
would work in all applications. For indoor applications, combustion engines are not well
suited due to noise and emissions, but recharging cycles can be planned with proper dock-
ing stations offering either pressurized gas, electricity, or hydrogen supply. For outdoor
applications, and long operational time requirements, energy harvesting will be utilized as
range extender, but the main power source will most likely become hydrogen or biofuels
due to practical reasons and cost.
The robot size has a signiﬁcant impact on energy source selection. Small scale with
short duty cycles robots can be operated with just energy harvesting mechanisms and
simple electric actuation systems that offer one energy source for all components is a clear
winner, cost for dense electrical energy storage in small scale can also be justiﬁed in many
applications. As the size of the robot increases and the duty cycle lengthens, denser energy
storage with lower costs per unit energy is needed or fast energy refuelling either by battery
swapping, tank reﬁll, or quick charging mechanisms is required. The larger the size of the
robot, the more beneﬁt can be gained from energy source diversiﬁcation and optimization
for individual active robotic components.
For each robot, designers solved problems of energy source. DURUS, an 80 kg robot,
used onboard 2.2 kWh lithium-polymer battery [103]. The BigDog robot, for instance,
utilizes a small go-cart petrol motor (11 kW) for driving hydraulic pump and electric
generator [174]; nevertheless, it was considered too noisy for military applications and
development was turned towards fully electric drive. Pneumatic actuation can be achieved
by integrating a compressor that is powered by electric or combustion motor, or by utilizing
an air tank for compressed air storage. Robot Lucy is an example where external compressed
air tanks or compressors are utilized [19].
Robots driven using hydraulic energy: PETMAN [89], ATLAS, and ATLAS DRC [102]
used external sources of supply pressure. ATLAS unplugged [102] used source placed on
board what increased mass from 152 kg to 182 kg. Actual version of ATLAS [103] based on
improved design of hydraulic system has, similar to humans, a mass of 80 kg with a height
of 151 cm.
Thangavelautham et al. [175] presents simulation results for a HOAP 2 humanoid robot
that suggests a fuel cell powered hybrid power supply, superior to conventional batteries.
Possibilities to use new energy sources present a 88 mg micro robot RoBeetle [176]
powered by catalytic combustion of methanol, whose speciﬁc energy is 5.6 kWh/kg. For
comparison, the speciﬁc energy of an animal fat 10.6 kWh/kg and a good Li-ion battery is
only 0.5 kWh/kg.
Intensive work is being carried out on the use of photovoltaics to power robots [177].
The relatively small surface area available for solar cells on the robot cannot convert enough
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
18 of 31
energy to keep the power-hungry robot functioning, but with the technology, the cheaper
perovskite cell achieves almost 24% efﬁciency, and specialist designs like the multi-junction
(MJ) solar cell achieves as much as 40% efﬁciency [177]. Successful solutions of a solar robot,
shaped like a sphere, are presented [178] and with wheels, Tertill [179] or Vitirover [180].
There is also a known small solar walking robot [181]. It is possible to use solar power to
charge of rechargeable battery pack humanoid robots such as ATLAS [177].
The intensive development of batteries related to the automotive industry [182] allows
us to expect that these sources will become the basic power supply for robots both in terms
of propulsion power andin hybrid systems and control. The main directions are:
•
Improve system of management of conventional Li-ion batteries;
•
Improved design of Li-ion batteries by changing construction and composition lowers
costs and improves performance (cobalt-free lithium-ion battery, mesoporous silicon
microparticles and carbon nanotubes, lithium-sulphur batteries);
•
New design and chemistry of batteries improve performance (vertically aligned carbon
nanotube (VACNT), aluminium-air light battery);
•
Design which improved time of charge (solid state lithium-ion batteries with sulphide
superionic conductors);
•
Structural batteries using carbon ﬁbres as the negative electrode while the positive is a
lithium iron phosphate; the latest battery has a stiffness of 25 GPa. It is possible to use
it to design superlight electric vehicles and also walking robots.
This promises that future batteries in a short time will be lighter and will achieve
much greater capacity, which will provide walking robots with a long operating time.
4.7. Energy Efﬁciency of the Walking Robot’s Motion
In some papers, the authors deal with the energy efﬁciency of a walking robot. This
issue is very important due to the fact that robots are equipped with a limited amount of
energy stored in the power source. This resource determines the range of the robot and
depends on the efﬁciency of the drive system. The issue of energy efﬁciency of moving
humans and animals was for the ﬁrst time analysed by Trucker [183], who introduced the
concept of the cost of transport (COT):
COT =
P
Wv
(4)
where: P—the power of move, W—weight, v—speed. Since the weight of the robot depends
on the mass and gravitational parameter, the cost can be also presented as follows [127]:
COT =
P
Mgv
(5)
where: P—Power of robot, M—mass of the robot, v—speed, g—standard gravitation.
Kajita et al. [184] and Sakagami et al. [185] proposed speciﬁc resistance (SR) as an
index for evaluating the energy efﬁciency of a mobile robot. It is based on the total energy
consumption of d distance to the gravitational potential energy:
SR =
E
Mgd
(6)
where: E—Energy consumption, M—mass of the robot, d—distance of the move.
SR parameter is equivalent to the COT parameter. If the parameters of (4), (5), or (6)
relations are all expressed in a consistent system of units, the quantity is dimensionless
and has the same value in any system of units. Kashiri et al. presented an overview of
principles for energy-efﬁcient robot locomotion [186]. Based on references, it is possible to
obtain some results of the COT or SR value of different robots and also to compare humans
and four-legged robots. For MIT’s cheetah quadruped, which exploits electrical energy
regeneration/recycling, the COT is about 0.5. A human is down around 0.2 [113], while
Asimo (54 kg) exhibits COT = 2 for 1.5 m/s [185]. In the DARPA competition between
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
19 of 31
robots, the best was SRI’s DURUS robot [113,187], which, with a fully charged battery,
walked a distance of 2.05 km to run the battery dry in 2 h, 35 min, 43 s. The walking of the
DURUS robot can be seen in the movie [114]. While walking, it used around 350 watts of
power, giving it an average COT of about 1.5, which is better than the Atlas robot, which
has a COT of 20 [113]. SRI estimates that in the future, it will be possible to obtain for the
DURUS robot a COT under 1, and with its onboard 2.2 kWh lithium-polymer battery, the
80 kg robot should be able to walk 10 km [113].
SANDIA laboratory’s present special design of Walking Anthropomorphic Novelly
Driven Efﬁcient Robot for Emergency Response (WANDERER) [123]. It is possible to see
the mechanism of the robot and its walking [124]. One of the best bipedal walking robots
in terms of transportation cost is Cassie [118,188]. The new design of the Cassie robot
(31 kg) has a low COT value, allowing Cassie to run for 6–8 h on a single charge. This
robot based on the original design obtains excellent running results, completing 5 km in
about 43 min [189]. When walking at 1.0m/s, using a total of 200 watts of power, while
performing different locomotion behaviours such as squatting, the calculated COT was 0.7.
For the LEO robot, v = 0.2 m/s COT = 108 was determined during walking [137]. When
walking on the ground, LEO sucks down 544 watts, of which 445 watts go to the propellers
and 99 watts are used by the electronics and legs [137]. LEO has a nominal walking speed
of 20 cm/sec, and its total velocity relative to the ground can undulate signiﬁcantly using
intermittent near-ground ﬂight. When ﬂying, LEO’s power consumption almost doubles; it
can also ﬂy with speeds of 1–3 m/s. This high value is due to the high energy expenditure
of the propeller drive system to stabilize the robot during gait. When ﬂying at v = 1 m/s,
COT = 48, and at v = 3 m/s, COT decreases to 15.5 [137].
5. Future of Bipedal Walking Robots
The future development of walking robots will depend on both the improvement and
the appearance of new constructions, drives, and the use of various sensors for control
movement systems as well as interactions with the environment and humans. Certainly, it
will require the improvement of the operating software.
5.1. Limitations of Development of Walking Robots
The main limitations thatcan be deduced from the previous studies can be summarized
as below:
•
Theoretical limitations—there is a lack of comprehensive theories regarding the biome-
chanics, kinematics, and mechanisms of control/coordinating gait, ambulation, and
clinical gait assessment; thus, it is hard to understand all aspects of bipedal gait, both
physiological and pathological, and reﬂect them within the bipedal walking robot.
•
Technical limitations—current technologies of bipedal walking robots are:
#
hard to assess due to limitations of computational models;
#
complicated design and control;
#
cost-effective only in several specialized applications, e.g., space exploration,
military purposes, etc.
•
Cognitive and ethical limitations—despite wide development (robots for the elderly,
robotic toys for children, etc.), there is a need to increase common attention to the
ethical limitations of using technology (including ICT and AI) for care interventions
for people with limited self-awareness, insight, and orientation.
5.2. Achievements and Opportunities
There is a clear increase in open-source walking robotics projects in the last decade [130].
This indicates that the walking mechanisms will be widely used by students and even
children, at ﬁrst as toys, and later as scientiﬁc projects. Awareness of robotic capabilities
in the general public is important before assistive robots and cooperation robots become
easily available and widespread. Knowing from experience how robots perceive their
surroundings and how to interact with them safely will lower psychological barriers that
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
20 of 31
people have against new inventions. This in turn should lead to market-driven research on
walking robotics directly applicable to common everyday tasks.
Bipedal walking robots may improve our understanding of the underlying neuronal
control as far as biomechanical principles, mechanics, and muscle functioning of gait in
individuals with gait impairments [147,149]. Modern bipedal robots are based on nat-
ural structures that move perfectly, both based on human gait patterns (ATLAS [103],
Valkyrie [111], etc.) or birds’ template (Cassie [118], Digit [122]). Owing to the advanced
sensory systems, precise, fast, and efﬁcient drives can perfectly cope with moving in
unknown terrain and respond to disturbances to maintain stability.
An important direction of development is the use of bipedal robot motion kinematics
based on bird gait and run. The Cassie robot undertook testing in 2021 (with operator
supervision) [189] and travelled 5 km in around 44 min at an average speed of 6.81 km/h.
In one lap, the robot reached 7.74 km/h. The maximum speed achieved by this robot on
long distances is more than the Atlas robot could achieve, as it reaches 5.4 km/h. Note,
however, that the Atlas uses a hydraulic drive, while the Cassie robot is powered by a DC
motor system. A bipedal walking robot became the basis for developing a neuromechani-
cal simpliﬁed planar musculoskeletal model of human lower body biomechanics with a
controller based on a dynamic artiﬁcial neural network with central pattern generators
(CPGs) coupled with force and motion feedback to generate the appropriate muscle forces
needed for walking. Separate neural networks generate the rhythm and create the gait
pattern, especially stable in the sagittal plane without inertial sensors, a centralized posture
controller or a walker in a manner similar to human walking (speed 0.850–1.289 m/s with
a leg length of 0.84 m, also on 5◦slopes without additional controller actions) [190]. An
underwater bipedal walking soft robot based on a coconut octopus was designed and a
machine vision algorithm was used to extract motion information for analysis—such a
walking robot can achieve an average speed of 6.48 cm/s [191]. The bipedal walking robot
has also become a test case for the use of shape memory alloy (SMA) springs as artiﬁcial
leg muscles [192]. This is important for, among other things, locomotion rehabilitation and
the development of assistive devices [193]. A better understanding of human movement
increases the possibility of successfully combining humans and technology.
In addition to the construction of bipedal robots based on nature bipeds (humans or
birds), the subject of research is unconventional solutions for bipedal robots:
•
Innovative walking robots with swivel feet [131–134] with very simple kinematics
provide excellent manoeuvrability (3 DOFs) and also the ability to climb stairs in the
4 DOFs version;
•
A two-legged robot called SLIDER [135,136], which uses a sliding joint in each leg to
replace the knee–hip rotary motion that is used in nature for leg lifting;
•
The bipedal robot LEO with a versatile design that enables two main modes of move-
ment by walking as well as ﬂight [137,138].
Especially the latter solution seems to be useful due to the possibility of the robot
moving both above the surface and in the air. Hence, the design and control of the
multimodal robotic locomotion LEO allows for rope walking or skateboarding, which were
previously challenges for bipedal robots [138].
5.3. Directions of Future Research
The aim of further work should be to combine the kinematics possibilities of bipedal
robots and the possibility of safe interaction with humans. The authors of [158] presented
a literature review on sensors of humanoid robot heads, especially focusing on aspects
related to human–robot interaction. It has been observed that the robotic vision is the most
widespread perception sensor system utilized in humanoid robots. This is mostly due
to the amount of information that vision provides about the surroundings. The authors
determined that there are two main types of humanoid robot heads and proposed a division
into robot heads with non-expressive faces and robot heads with expressive faces. The
latter is more human-like and, therefore, often perceived as more friendly. This will be
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
21 of 31
the direction of further work along with the development of artiﬁcial intelligence, hybrid
intelligence, and embodied intelligence of robots [194,195].
Taking into consideration wider perspective directions for further research should
focus on:
•
from a scientiﬁc point of view: knowledge sharing, including open-source solutions;
•
from a technological point of view: on the development of robot navigation and
artiﬁcial intelligence systems;
•
from an organizational point of view: interdisciplinary collaboration among various
research centres, virtual research teams, platforms for experiences, knowledge, and
project sharing;
•
from a clinical point of view: taking into consideration advanced applications of the
aforementioned solutions in everyday therapy;
•
from a societal and industrial point of view: dissemination of the knowledge and
experiences, building social awareness concerning wider use of the bipedal robot
walking in various areas of the daily life.
The most important research goals for the next several years may cover:
•
high-quality studies to address research gaps within neural control and biomechanics
of bipedal gait;
•
the use of a highly dynamic hydraulic drive and the use of an innovative sensors
system based on the LIDAR scanner system combined with an artiﬁcial vision system
using stereo cameras set a completely new level in the ﬁeld of robot’s world analysis;
•
space exploration plans will mostly beneﬁt from the development of autonomous
walking robotics [194];
•
a very important direction of the development of the bipedal walking robots mech-
anism will be further efforts to ﬁnd solutions with high energy efﬁciency (low COT
value). The goal is to approach and maybe even overcome the limit COT = 0.2 deﬁned
for some human walking conditions. This will allow increasing the range of robots
with limited battery capacity.
5.4. Main Direction of Walking Robot Applications
The work carried out in the ﬁeld of robot kinematics has produced valuable results
indicating the possibilities of developing robot applications in various ﬁelds. Now walking
robots are able to move both in urban terrain with uniﬁed ﬂat wall and ﬂoor surfaces
and stairs. Today’s robots are able to move in terrain with unfamiliar conﬁgurations. The
development of energy sources and the improvement of energy efﬁciency point to the
possibility of covering considerable distances. Some robots equipped with hands and
touch sensors and equipped with a vision and recognition system can manipulate objects
using cooperation of the upper limbs (Atlas [103], Digit [112]). Robots are also capable
of using tools. In parallel with the development of the design and kinematics of robots,
the development of artiﬁcial intelligence of robots is progressing. These developments
are taking place at a pace beyond recent imaginings. Today’s robots can soon replace
humans in dangerous and tedious tasks. Robots are being developed for tasks in space
(Valkyrie [111]). Work is being carried out also on the use of walking robots for military
purposes. The use of robots is likely to be driven by the need to increase productivity and
save the environment.
Additionally, research on bipedal walking robots contributes to the scientiﬁc under-
standing of human movement, including the transition from walking to running [195]. The
development of assisted locomotion with the use of exoskeletons may eventually make
it possible to do away with wheelchairs or ramps, and disabled people will be able to
enter places where fully able-bodied people enter. Bipedal locomotion and upright body
position are also necessary for proper functioning of the human body (e.g., bladder and
bowel function—certain muscles have to tense up and to relax).
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440

Research into bipedal walking robots, both towards improving kinematic capabilities
and developing artiﬁcial intelligence, could spur the creation of further well-designed
assistive technologies:
•
Solving problems in uncertain environments and assistance in hazardous places—
ﬁreﬁghter support, zones with radioactive contamination, extreme temperatures,
explosion risk zones, mines, outer space, etc.
•
In the future, intelligent bipedal robots can be used in factories to serve as a replace-
ment or a collaborator for human workers;in services for jobs that require taking on
strenuous, uncomfortable positions or low-paying jobs that humans do not want to do,
interactive robots may open new chances toward human–robot relationships, social
awareness, activity monitoring, activity eliciting, and learning.
•
Artificial environments such as virtual reality and augmented reality and brain–computer
interface (BCI)may be more advanced alternatives for the traditional human–robot
interface, providing multimodal interaction comparable to inter-human communication.
•
Mobile technologies open new possibilities of remote control, e.g., for children/elderly
safety and telemedicine/telerehabilitation purposes, as well as a general condition,
sport, and leisure activities.
•
Application of intelligent robots in space missions, both on their own and in supporting
people, which may require the ability to walk.
•
In conclusion, it should be stated that we are approaching the moment when robots in
a much more perfect form than so far will enter our lives on two legs equipped with
human-friendly artiﬁcial intelligence.
6. Conclusions
The presented survey of the literature as well as the previous work of the authors
allows the formulation of the following conclusions:
•
The artiﬁcial gait solutions of legged robots are based on the essence of the biolog-
ical standard that has been created in the natural process of evolution through the
development of joint muscles and the excellent biological control system;
•
Gait inspirations for versatile application of walking robots can be gained from birds,
insects, or other animals, not popularly used in walking research currently;
•
Characterizing the essence of human gait and achieving it inmechatronics, drives, and
control systems enabled the creation of solutions imitating this way of locomotion;
•
The artiﬁcial gait systems based on a human biological pattern are built with varying
degrees of complexity from 12–30 DOFs (close to human kinematics) to 6 DOFs or less
(extremely simpliﬁed);
•
Models imitating human gait mainly use electric drives with various motor types; in
addition, especially recently developed walkers provide excellent performance using
hydraulic drives or artiﬁcial muscles as in the Atlas robot;
•
The new advanced design of bipedal robots based on natural patterns are Cassie and
Digit, which use the pattern of bird gait. These robots use, with success, electric drives
and are the fastest bipedal walking robots nowadays;
•
The newly proposed solution based on the unique (synthetic) idea is a walking robot
without a knee (10 DOFs);
•
The bipedal innovative walking mechanism with excellent manoeuvrability equipped
with two legs sliding in body with swivel feet allow to move on ﬂat terrain at 3 DOFs,
and at 4 DOFs, also climbing stairs becomes possible;
•
An interesting design of walking robots is the robot Leo with a versatile drive, which
can gait on two legs as a bipedal robot and ﬂy as a drone;
•
The conventional sensor system of advanced solution biped walking robots needs
ﬁve categories of sensors systems of body orientation, foot sole, force, touch, vision,
and audio.These kinds of sensors need both to solve the problem of moving robots by
walking and communication of robots with the environment;
Sensors 2022, 22, 4440
23 of 31
•
Modern bipedal walking robots allow movement on ﬂat surfaces in the ﬁeld, the best
solutions of a bipedal robot equipped with visual and LIDAR sensors can be used in
uneven terrain to solve problems in conditions dangerous for humans—ﬁre hazards,
radioactive contamination hazards, or in outer space;
•
Advanced walking robots that are based on natural biped gait need complicated drive
and control systems with many sensors. This is related to the stabilization of the
inverted pendulum system created by the legs. This problem does not exist in the
presented biped (3 DOFs or 4 DOFs) walking robots with swivel feet;
•
Combining the possibilities of building bipedal walking robots and equipping them
with AI and human communication systems such as speech synthesis and recognition,
and affective computing systems open new applications for these robots;
•
The running time of the robots depends both on the performance of the power supply
system but also on the COT parameter, which reaches for the DURUS robot a value
of 1.5, and for the CASSIE robot COT = 0.7, when for humans the observed value is
COT = 0.2;
•
Walking robots use both hydraulic drives (ATLAS), which provide the greatest dy-
namics, and electric drives (DURUS, CASSIE, etc.). Rapid development of powerful
batteries suitable for fast recharging is foreseen.
Modern robots have reached an excellent level of construction design, and drive sys-
tems that are capable to mimic perfectly natural walking, including automated locomotion
in unknown terrain. It is especially important that the robots should become user-friendly
and would not be in any way dangerous. The military applications of biped robotics are
somewhat disturbing and might create a physical barrier to introduce biped robots into
civil applications.
Future research will focus on the development of robot navigation and intelligence
systems, as well as the interfaces for communication and collaboration with humans.
Taking into consideration a wider perspective, directions for further research should
focus on:
•
from a scientiﬁc point of view: knowledge sharing, including open-source solutions;
•
from a technological point of view: on the development of robot navigation and
artiﬁcial intelligence systems;
•
from an organizational point of view: interdisciplinary collaboration among various
research centres, virtual research teams, platforms for experiences, knowledge, and
project sharing;
•
from a clinical point of view: taking into consideration advanced applications of the
aforementioned solutions in everyday therapy;
•
from a societal and industrial point of view: dissemination of the knowledge and
experiences, building social awareness concerning wider use of the bipedal robot
walking in various areas of the daily life.
As authors represent nine independent research centres, each centre works on its
project to solve part of the larger problem. We have developed collaboration mechanisms
for remote group work utilizing online meeting platforms and cloud document sharing to
facilitate long-distance teamwork. Information exchange and synchronization in terms of
research funding applications are one of the keys to organizing distributed expert groups
for multidisciplinary problems.
